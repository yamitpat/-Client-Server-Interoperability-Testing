This project uses the Hugging Face image classification API.
To keep the API token secure and ensure the code runs for everyone, we use a .env file and environment variables.
To use the real Hugging Face API, create a file named .env in the /server directory
Inside this file, add: HF_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
Replace your_token_here with your actual Hugging Face API token (can be generated from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

No token? It still works!
If the .env file is missing or the HF_API_TOKEN variable is not set, the server will automatically fall back to mock classification results. This ensures the app is fully testable without any external setup.
This design lets:
* Graders test the server without needing a token ✅
* Developers test locally without worrying about secrets ✅
* Users get real classification results when a token is provided ✅

To enable .env support, we use python-dotenv. Be sure to install all server dependencies
